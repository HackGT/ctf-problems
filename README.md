# HackGT CTF Public Repo

Welcome to the HackGT CTF Public repo, we are thrilled that we were able to run this event for two consecutive years!

This repo will contain all past CTF problems! Feel free to use this to practice or answer any burning questions you had after the last two events!

## Something missing?
Feel free to make an issue if anything (including writeups) are missing or unclear, or make a pull request if you want!
