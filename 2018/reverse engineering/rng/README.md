# RNG
## Description
MegaSecureCorp just submitted a cryptographically secure random byte generator for the National Secure Standards competition, but they didn't even include the source code!

As a result, our panel of judges are pretty skeptical of this random byte generator. If you can tell us the mostly likely generated byte along with its probability (first 10 decimal digits without rounding), we'll be very impressed!

## Flag Format:
Flag format should be the byte in hex concatenated with the first ten decimal digits of the generation probability:

<center>

`hackgt{<byte-in-hex><first-ten-decimal-digits-probability>}`

</center>


If the byte ff has the highest generation probability 0.12345678905555555, the flag would be the following:

<center>

`hackgt{ff1234567890}`

</center>
