Welcome to Harmony! We're aiming to be the best chat program in the world.

To run harmony, you'll need python3 with PyQt5 and protobuf installed
from pip. You may want to use a virtualenv to keep the system clean.

To run the chat client, it's pretty simple:
    python3 client/client.py SERVER_IP_ADDRESS

Once started, a GUI should pop up. Register a new account and you're on
your way!

NOTE: DO NOT use a real username/password with this service

HINT: Try messaging the admin user
