# One Time Fad

## Description
The competitors interact with a broken decryption service whose source code has been leaked and provided to the competitors (broken_decrypt.py). The competitors are also given an encrypted flag (flag.enc).

## Objective
Decrypt the flag using this broken decryption service.

## NOTES
You'll probably have a better time with this if you're using python 3.
